    "summary": "The video covers the concept of fine-tuning in the context of artificial neural networks, emphasizing its link to transfer learning. Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adjusting it for a new, but related, task, allowing developers to leverage existing learned features rather than starting from scratch. The process includes modifying the structure of an original model, freezing its original layers to preserve learned weights, and training only the new layers with data relevant to the new task. The video provides examples and encourages viewers to explore further technical implementations.",
