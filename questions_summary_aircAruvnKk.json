    "summary": "The video explains the foundational structure of neural networks, particularly in the context of recognizing handwritten digits. It discusses how neural networks consist of layers of neurons where each neuron holds a numerical value (activation) based on pixel brightness. The input layer consists of 784 neurons, each representing a pixel of a 28x28 grayscale image. The output layer has 10 neurons corresponding to the digits 0-9. The video describes how hidden layers process inputs through weighted connections and biases, influenced by the activation of previous layers. This layered architecture allows the network to gradually recognize patterns, resembling how human brains operate. The video aims to demystify neural networks, emphasizing their mathematical structure and making them accessible for those unfamiliar with the concept.",
